# Employee Management System

## Description
    
The Employee Management System is a command-line interface and content management system. This CLI is capable of creating, reading, updating, and deleting persistent storage (also known as CRUD functionality). Utilizing MySQL databases and the Inquirer npm package, this program allows you to add, remove or update employees, roles, and departments in a user friendly interface. Information about employees such as their title, salary, and department can also be viewed in a simple and organized table using npm's console.table package. Look no further for your next, easy-to-use CMS for all your CRUD needs!
